<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This is a variant of chess where instead of there being borders on the laft and right side of the board, thte board wraps. Basically, if a piece goes off the left side of the board, it will reappear on the right side of the board. Otherwise, all the rules of normal chess still exist and pieces all move the same including enpassent and castling.

For example, if a rook was on a1 and there was a bishop on c1, the rook could get to d1 by sliding off the left side of the board, appearing on the right, and continuing to d1. It may be helpful to think of it as there being 3 of the exact same boards laid beside eachother. If the white queen from the middle board sees the black king on the right board, black is in check.
